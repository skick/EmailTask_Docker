MySQLi extension is needed for connecting to MySQL.
However, MySQL is not necessarily needed, because there is an option to save emails to a .txt file also.
I used XAMPP for running Apache server and MySQL.
MySQL database and table can be created by using phpmyadmin.
The name of the database needs to be 'emails'.
The query needed for creating the table can be found in database.sql.
The source files need to be located in xampp/htdocs when using XAMPP.
